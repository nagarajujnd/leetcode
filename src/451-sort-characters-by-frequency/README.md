# 160.Sort Characters By Frequency

## Description

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

## Example1

```javascript
Input: "tree"
Output: "eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

## Example2

```javascript
Input: "cccaaa"

Output: "cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

## Example3

```javascript
Input: "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```
